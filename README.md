## 🛠️ Technologies

The Blogger project is built with the following technologies:

- **ASP.NET Core MVC**: Utilizes Model-View-Controller architecture for separating concerns.
- **.NET 6**: Leverages the latest version of .NET for optimal performance and cross-platform support.
- **Entity Framework Core**: For database operations and object-relational mapping (ORM).
- **FluentValidation**: Validation of data transfer objects (DTOs) and models.
- **Razor Pages**: For generating dynamic web content.
- **RESTful API**: Provides REST API endpoints for managing blog posts, users, and comments.
- **Email Sender Service**: Integrated email service to send notifications.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Role-based security with JWT support for API security.

📄 API Documentation
The Blogger application exposes a set of RESTful API endpoints for managing blogs, users, and other resources. You can explore these APIs using tools like Postman or Swagger (if configured).

Example API Endpoints
GET /api/blogs - Retrieves a list of blog posts
POST /api/blogs - Creates a new blog post
PUT /api/blogs/{id} - Updates an existing blog post
DELETE /api/blogs/{id} - Deletes a blog post
GET /api/categories - Retrieves a list of categories
POST /api/categories - Creates a new category
Authentication via JWT (JSON Web Token) is required for some endpoints.

🛡️ Security
Authentication: The application uses ASP.NET Core Identity for user authentication.
Authorization: Role-based authorization is implemented with predefined roles (Admin, Editor, User).
HTTPS: Ensure HTTPS is configured in production for secure data transfer.
📧 Email Configuration
To configure email notifications, update the email service settings in appsettings.json:

json
Kodu kopyala
"EmailSettings": {
  "SmtpServer": "smtp.yourprovider.com",
  "SmtpPort": 587,
  "SenderEmail": "no-reply@yourdomain.com",
  "SenderName": "Blogger Team",
  "Password": "your-email-password"
}
